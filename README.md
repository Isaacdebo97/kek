## Esports

Esports has exploded in the last fifteen years. A competitive industry and a booming industry worth billions of dollars where teams, leagues, players, merchandisers, sponsors, and broadcasters make money competing with even the NFL and FIFA. Despite still having a cold reputation in mainstream media, it is evident by the numbers that the global gaming industry is here to stay. This blog will explain all the aspects in which Esports has grown, and how one can understand how to leverage it.

## Newzoo

Newzoo began global esports and live streaming market reports in 2021, which monitors the latest esports market trends and developments until 2024. They understand and recognize the significant role that livestreaming plays in the esports and gaming worlds. 

Newzoo defines Esports as being “Professional or semi professional competitive gaming in an organised format (tournament or league) with a specific goal,prize, such as winning a championship title or prize money).” The statistics in this blog relate to professional competitive gaming only and not amateur competitions, live streaming or casual gaming. There is, in fact, a distinction between the esports market and live-streaming market simply due to the fact that the latter tends to be less competitive. 


## Going Corporate

Realising this booming market, some brands have made significant esports market investments. This has further increased the revenue in the industry. According to Newzoo, the average revenue increased by more than 30% annually in 2018. Despite the fact that the rate of increase decreased at that point, it was 900 million dollars, a 23% YOY growth, this net growth is not a number to be laughed at.
